  and midwestern lakes

# Introduction
Lake eutrophication, by nature, is the process of lake aging in which the lakes are filled with sediments and the settlement of dead flora and fauna in the lake bottom. Nowadays, anthropogenic eutrophication is the accelerated process in which excess amount of nutrients from human activities stimulate the aquatic plants' growth and increase the lake productivity. Some researchers have argued that the past efforts to reduce the entrance of nutrients into rivers and lakes have not necessarily resulted in improved water quality (e.g. [Oliver et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13810)). However, lake restoration is supposed to take several decades for most lakes to show results. Also, the aim of some actions for lake management is to enhance water quality during the warm season when the lake productivity is higher due to the higher temperature of the lake. The main aim of this study is to investigate the intra-annual trends of lake ecological conditions.
 

# Materials and methods
In order to investigate the trends of lake eutrophication, the LAke multi-scaled GeOSpatioal and temporal database [LAGOS](https://lagoslakes.org/) is used. The LAGOSNE package is composed of the data from 51101 lakes and reservoirs in lake-rich areas of the US ([Soranno et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix101) and [Stachelek et al., 2017](https://cran.r-project.org/package=LAGOSNE)). The first step 



Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

<!-- ```{r, warning=F}  -->
<!-- ## define which species to query -->
<!-- sp='Turdus migratorius' -->

<!-- ## run the query and convert to data.frame() -->
<!-- d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This can take a few seconds. -->

<!-- ```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"} -->
<!-- # Load coastline -->
<!-- map=map_data("world") -->

<!-- ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+ -->
<!--   geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+ -->
<!--   geom_point(col="red")+ -->
<!--   coord_equal() -->
<!-- ``` -->


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hist(d$latitude) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
